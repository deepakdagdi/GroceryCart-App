The platform allows users to explore a variety of grocery items, manage their cart, and complete purchases online. An admin panel allows store managers to control inventory, view orders, and manage users.This project simulates a real-world grossery
grocery delivery system and demonstrates the use of modern web development tools, API integrations, role-based access control, and secure payment handling.
